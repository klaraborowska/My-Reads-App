# My Reads App
7th project of Google Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Scholarship at Udacity. 

### App Functionality
My Reads is a bookshelf app that allows user to select and categorize books. The main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:
- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Each book has a control that lets select the shelf. Default value for the control is the current shelf the book is in.
